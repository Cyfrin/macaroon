# Macaroon

![](./macaroons.jpg)

A fun skin for [moccasin](https://pypi.org/project/moccasin/). Head there for docs.

# Installation

The same as moccasin, except you run:

```bash
uv tool install macaroon
```

And get the executables:

```
roon
macaroon
```

Have fun!

# Background

Truffle, Brownie, Ganache, Drizzle... What happened to the sweetness of web3?
